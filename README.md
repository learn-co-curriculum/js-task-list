# Task Lists

## Description

In this lab, you'll be creating a simple JavaScript task list. You've been provided with the HTML skeleton, but will need to implement the JS code in the `js/tasklist.js` directory.

You can see a working copy live at: [http://learn-co-curriculum.github.io/task-list/](http://learn-co-curriculum.github.io/task-list/)

1. Add jQuery UI Sortable to the list so that tasks can be dragged and dropped to reorder.

### Running Jasmine Tests in Chrome

The tests for this lab use Jasmine, a testing framework for JavaScript that runs in your browser. To run the tests, first quit Chrome if it is running and then launch it from your terminal with `/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --allow-file-access-from-files`. Then, from a new terminal tab, (command T), run `ironboard -b`.
